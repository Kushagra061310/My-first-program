Project Summary – Employee Salary CRUD Manager (Python)


This project is a simple console-based Employee Salary Management System built in pure Python without using any external libraries or imports.
It allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) employee records, including their name, ID, position, and salary.


--> Features
Insert Employee – Add new employee details with unique ID.
View Employees – Display all stored employee records.
Update Employee – Modify existing employee details (name, position, or salary).
